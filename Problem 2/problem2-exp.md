Explanation of the Solution
Initialize Pointers: left starts at the beginning (0) and right at the end of the array (len(height) - 1).

Loop Until Pointers Meet: We calculate the area for the current container defined by left and right.

Calculate Area:
current_height = min(height[left], height[right]) finds the height of the container based on the shorter line.
width = right - left computes the container width.
current_area = current_height * width gives the area for this container, and we update max_area if current_area is larger.

Move the Pointers:
Move the pointer corresponding to the shorter height inward to try to find a taller line for a potentially larger area.

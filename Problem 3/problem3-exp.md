Explanation of the Solution

DP Table Initialization: We create a 2D table dp where dp[i][j] represents if s[:i] (first i characters of s) matches p[:j] (first j characters of p).

Base Cases:
dp[0][0] = True because an empty pattern matches an empty string.
For dp[0][j] (where s is empty), dp[0][j] is True only if p[:j] can represent an empty sequence, i.e., has patterns like a*, a*b*, etc.

Filling the DP Table:
Direct Match: If p[j-1] matches s[i-1] or p[j-1] is '.', we carry over the match from dp[i-1][j-1].

Handling '*':
We consider '*' as representing zero of the preceding element by setting dp[i][j] = dp[i][j-2].

If s[i-1] matches the character preceding '*' in p (or if that character is '.'), we also consider the case where '*' matches one or more occurrences of the preceding character by setting dp[i][j] = dp[i][j] or dp[i-1][j].

Final Result: The value in dp[len(s)][len(p)] will give us whether the entire string s matches the entire pattern p.
